In this experiment, we trained and evaluated two pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) models, DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2, on a large dataset consisting of agricultural plant leaf images to predict diseases. The goal was to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy and loss.
After training the models, we obtained promising results. DenseNet121 achieved an accuracy of 92.49% with a loss of 22.69%, while MobileNetV2 achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 93.05% with a loss of 20.81%. The suggested framework seeks to improve agricultural practices' effectiveness, precision, and sustainability by analyzing the dataset and using cutting-edge deep learning algorithms.
